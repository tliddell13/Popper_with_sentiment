Nope not at all all the cakes that had strawberries were I lil off the strawberries looked old but I think maybe they just got a lil dryed out .....nope old as the Vegas strip.....molded as well just gross a cake full of moldy strawberries.....I am so displeased by this don't go here if u want a fresh cake !!!!,negative
"Need to consider opening earlier than 7 am. I was very discouraged yelp did not have the hours posted & I drove across town and was told they were not open. I saw the donuts and employees, but didn't get to try them yet.",negative
So so oooooooo disappointing this place besides the long wait time the staff is rude and pushy to take the order now as a customer and a fan I expected more from this bakery I have always watched the tv show and the pastry look really good but no not at all in this location the cannoli filled with vanilla was not good is was simple no taste now before that I ask one of the staff that was controlling the line what was her suggestion and which one she recommended she simply said oh sry I haven't tried anything yet am new I just been working for around a month wow Carlo bakery you need to let your employees try your pastry how can they recommend or say to customer which item is good if you don't let them try it before the consumer,negative
"Great ice cream always, poor service in my experiences. I have been to this location many times as I live very near, and they always seem to be understaffed and have no clear way of forming lines or serving people. It can get frustrating. I'm sure in the winter or slow days this is far less of a problem. The Zanzibar chocolate is on point as can be and that keeps me going back! There are seemingly millions of flavors, so many to pick from and all kinds of float, shake, cone, and even ice cream flight options.",positive
"I would have tried every single flavor if there weren't 20 people in line behind me. This place is amazing! Their flavors are unique and awesome! I tried as many as I could and every one was so good... Nutella, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, ""movie night,"" Red velvet... All delicious. I ended up getting their ""cookie cup"" cause I'm obsessed with macarons and it didn't disappoint! It had a couple scoops of blueberry muffin ice cream with a scoop of peanut butter ice cream and a vanilla macaroon, topped with a marshmallow they torch right before handing you your heaven in a cup. Honestly, if you're an ice cream fanatic, give this place a try. Even if you're not, you should still check it out! ;) A few people in front of me got shakes that also looked amazing.",positive
"These were delicious cupcakes--meeting my expectations for a $3-4 cupcake (as I realize cost is due to the Sprinkles namesake). The marshmallow chocolate with ganache was great, though it wasn't really so much marshmallow as it should be. It actually reminded me more of the filling in the hostess chocolate cakes from years ago. The chocolate was dark, the perfect amount of sweetness, and definitely not dry. I think this was my favorite, even though it is quite plain. The vanilla was actually disappointing in terms of flavor of cake and icing, but was moist. My husband loved his peanut butter cupcake, but I didn't get to try it. The cupcakes are both beautiful and simple.",positive
"Love ice cream? Love cereal? Love sweets in general? This is the place for you. Love a little booze with your milk shake? Even better. We came here mid-day, and it was just the right time for something sweet - and something boozy. I had the fancy birthday cake shake. It was made perfectly so the Kahlua wasn't overpowering and you had plenty of sweet birthday cake flavor. At $12, I thought it was fairly priced since I've had other boozy shakes in Vegas for $15 and over. They had other sweet treats, and I bough pumpkin pie cake truffles (only available in November). They were definitely sweet, but they came packaged so that was a little odd. I expected something freshly made. They were still plenty yummy. If you have time, or even have kids, this is a fun place to stop for some sweet treats.",positive
"Let me start with the positives. This shop has a great vibe to it, and the family seems passionate about it. The young employees always bust their behinds, running in such a small space so fluently, tackling the long lines. They also have an endless menu board of various food and treats. The prices are reasonable. Now for the reason for two stars. The ice cream is absolutely terrible. I have had three very different items off the menu, over a three year period, desperately trying to figure out the hype and find something good. I'm sorry, but everything was downright awful. The third, and final attempt, I had such high hopes, but despite how great my sundae looked, half of it ended up in the trash. My bf also tossed his. Not only was it tasteless and disappointing (even the brownie and cookie were terrible), 3/3 times I've been there, it upset my stomach. Mind you, I eat ice cream almost every single day, and have been to over 30 shops, and never had a problem. In fact, my bf, myself, and even my dog all had audibly gurgling stomachs soon after consumption. I'm sorry, but the hype is just unreal to me. This ranks 33 of 33 places I've gotten ice cream. I believe the hype is pure nostalgia from people that grew up going there, addicted to the memories and passing tradition on, not because it's actually fantastic. There are reasons to love it, but if you're going to an ice cream shop for the ice cream, you may be greatly disappointed. (If you care about covid, I drove past twice a week, and there was never any social distancing last year/giant crowds all bundled together in line, and not many customers wore masks. It's as if a pandemic wasn't going on)",negative
"I was surprised to this is a walk up place with no seating. We went on a weekend evening and the line was 10 minutes long easy. They had two windows open taking orders and moved through the line efficiently, there was just a lot of people. The ice cream was amazing! Highly recommend and the line is worth it.",positive
Toasted coconut with salted carmel. Do it! That's all I am going to say. Oh and the Macaroons!,positive
"What a lovely stop in the area near the Linq in the promenade and near the High Roller. We had just come from the High Roller and I was trying relax after that. This place is a mecca for chocolate. We decided to by the Ghirardelli squares and they were sold by the pound so then we felt compelled to buy a pound. In retrospect, don't do this. Get a few and be done. We had chocolate every day for days. Probably not what the doctor ordered. It was oh so good, however. We also had hot chocolate there. That was very tasty. They want to put whipping cream on everything so if you are not into that catch them quick or you will have so much whipped topping people may mistake you for St Nick. In all seriousness, this is a cute spot with tasty delights I can see why they included this in the shopping promenade. I will definitely stop in again.",positive
"Let's get our sprinkle and sparkle on. Cream cheese frosting. Can you taste your favorite flavor, long for that soft fluffy sweetness. Cupcakes and ice cream in one place all together. Cupcakes will one day be the best way to celebrate our difficult differences. Decisions will be decided. Those that are in power must realize that the cylindrical shaped cups of love are way to powerful to resist. These treasured delights are the moments that are full of such harmony. Happiness can be achieved over coffee, tea, and cupcakes; period. The human race just needs to come to this realization before it's too late. So many delicious flavors and varieties could be achieved. When will they learn. Let's start the lesson without those individuals. We're talking cupcakes today, name the flavor and it's here. Deliciousness in a cylindrical culinary crush. Just walk through the door and let's start the process of ordering. The cupcakes are baked fresh here on sight each and every morning. The crew that calls this ""work"" knows that their company supports so many great causes and their ultimate happiness as equal human beings in all walks of life. Last month, June 2019 was Pride month. The whole month Sprinkles had a special cupcake just for this special occasion. They offered by special order an eight tier rainbow cake done just for pride month too. Companies that dedicate this much support to special causes are trying to make the world a better place. It's July 2019, Sprinkles is celebrating America's birthday with cupcakes that are red, white, and blue. They should be called Freedom cakes, but the causes that the company celebrates is authentic and geared towards many choices for all individuals to enjoy. The cupcakes always deliver here, never have I had a ""bad"" cupcake from any Sprinkles anywhere. This particular location is located on the board walk near the Linq Ferris wheel. A prime local right next to In and Out, by the large fountain in the court yard by the Flamingo Hotel and Casino. It's not easily allowable accessibility by car, but their is ample parking out by the Linq hotel. Unfortunately the parking for the Linq is no longer complimentary. The Flamingo Hotels parking garage is your best bet which is free. Now using the Valet at the Flamingo is costly. Either way you make your way to this Sprinkles it's worth the cost. Make a day out of it. Come for In and Out yummy burgers, then have cupcakes from Sprinkles for dessert. Come love one another, hand and hand, spread your love and beauty around. Embrace what it means to be accepted, no matter what your race, gender, sex, or other disposition in life. Let the pride of the rainbow embrace thee and wrap its spirit around your soul. Come soar with us, know your potential has no limits. Let you have no boundaries to soar high above all. Become whatever your soul and psyche beckon to you. You are special no matter whom you are. Let no one ever steal your light. Always remember that kindness should be in heart and love light the way.",positive
"The cookies are definitely not worth it. (Maybe the ice cream and shakes are). We stopped here for a visit bc i was interested in trying some of the treats that Christina Tosi is known for. This was particularly true since I've considered signing up for her online baking class and love to watch her judge MasterChef Junior. Imagine my surprise when, after paying $4 per cookie, we were handed two shrink-wrapped pre-packaged items, the Confetti and the Compost. Don't get me wrong, they were tasty, but at that price point we are expecting fresh-baked, preservative-free cookies at a minimum. The cookies didn't particularly WOW either of our taste buds and I'd say they were probably on-par with other cookies I've had from Panera that are larger AND cheaper. I will say that I was surprised at how the pretzels retained their crunch. But my husband's stomach ended up being unhappy for the rest of the evening which typically only happens when he consumes a preservative that disagrees with it. Would not recommend, go to Bouchon Bakery instead for your fix.",negative
"Really cool spot for sweets! Highly recommend checking this place out, super nice staff and good snacks.",positive
"The pictures definitely are a trick. Not at all like them, looks like a run down gas station that just happens to serve ice cream and not gas. The lady working though was very friendly and did a great job!!!",negative
I was so surprised to see Milk Bar at the Cosmopolitan! We were there for breakfast sandwiches from Eggslut and ran right into it. Unfortunately it wasn't opened yet. We decided to come back later in the day to get our fix because it's always crowded in our neighborhood. The crack pie is so damn good! I like to eat it at room temperature. We picked up a few slices and had it as an after dinner treat later in the evening. Of course it was as good as I remembered and I wanted another slice but the guilt of how much sugar is in a slice helped me balance that lol. I'm not quite sure what they put into that pie buts is damn delicious! I can totally understand why they call it crack pie because you always want more. I would definitely recommend that one tries the crack pie and the other treats that milk bar has to offer because everything is good. Crack pie is most definitely the star of the show!,positive
"Today, Father's Day, was our first time at Jack Frost Donuts. It was to be a treat for my husband who had been wanting to go for a long time. We've heard great things for awhile. So I planned this and nothing else for Father's Day because he was going to be spending the rest of the day on a ladder in the heat painting our house. I thought it would be nice to let him sleep in but when we showed up at 11am there was nothing left. My husband had for the first time in 7 years of marriage actually been so excited about this present that he smiled and high fived me. Never have I gotten anything but a ""meh"" from him for ANYTHING before. But when we walked in and were told they were sold out four hours after opening with no plans to restock their shelves for the rest of the 9 hours they were supposed to be open, my husband was so disappointed. and so was I. I had finally done something that he really wanted and it was ruined because they run a crappy business. They don't even have a website or a menu!! When we walked in, the girl at the counter asked us if we had pre-ordered? Were we supposed to? How would we know to do that? Where is that requirement posted???? We will NEVER go back. They may have trendy donuts that everyone is going bonkers for now but they suck at customer service and they lost me today. Screw it. I'll buy a dozen glazed donuts at the store, shoot whip cream all over them and sprinkle a bunch of Reese's Pieces on them. Done.",negative
"Snooty, cool kids place, frozen pastries, not paying minimum wage: Sound like Paris to you?",negative
"I was looking for an ice cream place late last night and found this place next to Jobots. The flavor choices are unique and everything I sampled was very good. I got a scoop of the Greek yogurt and the carrot cake I wish I got a scoop of the cucumber sorbet, but I knew I couldn't finish 3 scoops. I love how the ice cream is served in a takeout container with a fortune cookie. Definitely a special little place!",positive
"One word...yummy! Get there early for a better selection as the donuts go fast. The folks are friendly and the food is really good. Fair prices for what you get, too!",positive
"I have tried to go to this bakery for years and everytime I visited the line was crazy. This week however there was no line so I decided to have a taste. I had the hazelnut croissant and a brownie with pecans and caramel. For a bakery with such hype, I was sadly disappointed in the quality. The croissant was over stuffed with hazelnut cream so it ended up oozing everywhere. The brownie also had only a couple of nuts on top with a little drizzle of caramel. The actual brownie was more like cake than a brownie.",negative
Unfortunate that you'll stand there waiting for service and no one will speak to you. Then another customer comes in and is immediately helped. Walked out without buying and will never visit this place again.,negative
"There was a week where my next door neighbors and I came here every night. Great ice cream, novelties, exotic flavors and floats!! Also the owner and staff are so friendly.",positive
"Great atmosphere, first time here was on a first date and it was an excellent choice to end a first date. Loved the pecan tart! Definitely my favorite!",positive
"First time here. Don't get the milkshake it's super watery, I went with the coffee flavor and I ended up throwing it away after 2 sips. The soft serve looked good.",negative
"So much for my diet but calories be damned--this is Ghirardelli! I got an amazing brownie and shared with no one. Family shared a banana split, some kind of cookie and ice cream. They loved everything. Staff were wonderful. I thought prices were reasonable for high quality products. There were some great sale items.",positive
We went here after enjoying dinner at Windsor next door. Everyone behind the counter was super friendly and encouraged us to sample a few flavors before deciding on one to order. I had the Caramel Cashew and it was delicious. My wife went for the Cookies and Mint. You can definitely tell the quality and homemade taste of the ice cream. A great follow up to the excellent dinner at Windsor.,positive
Tonight I went to Jeni's (which I LOVE the ice cream) but I paid for a double(plus tip 10$ total) and got a single (2 bites of ice cream)... Obviously the line was super long and it's during covid 19 so they were busy and I didn't have a chance go back to the register. I'm so upset.,negative
The strawberry sorbet was amazing. My wife had brown butter pecan ice cream it as the bomb. A must stop for ice cream,positive
Overrated and too expensive for what it is. The only thing I enjoyed was the toasted marshmallow and the macaroon. The ice cream was bland and not that creamy. I tasted a number of different options that all tasted like bland soggy cereal. Staff was very patient with me during the tasting.,negative
"oh jack frost, how lucky i am to have you right down the street from my house. nostalgia has got to be one of the key ingredients in these donuts. you can almost taste the love that goes into these and i can promise that someone's great grandma is involved here. perfect, don't change a thing.",positive
"All you have to say is ""Babcock Hall Ice Cream"" The best in the state. This shop is in the Memorial Union in addition to the location near the dairy barns in Babcock Hall. Going to Babcock Hall as a child was always a treat for our family. Glad it's now easier to get to in the Memorial Union. All the flavors are great tasting.",positive
"I'm pretty easy to impress - I love to give good reviews! This place though, kind of a let down. The cupcake was OK, probably 3 stars... But the order and payment process was a joke. The cupcakes are right there, hand me one and take my 4 dollars!!! Rather than this simple concept which most bakeries, coffee shops, and every other type of retailer have mastered... you order, they write it down (meanwhile the cupcake is still right there).. They take the order in the back (not sure what happens there), then return, grab the cupcake (still one foot from where you are standing), and place it on the back counter. At that point you wait about 3-5 minutes while the 1 cashier catches up, grabs the cupcake, and finally takes your payment. It wasn't just us... Everyone in the store was just standing around asking what was going on... Very strange. And sorry, for $4 the cupcake should be amazing. It just wasn't.",negative
Had the coffee n it was smooth n delicious Best coffee I've ever had. Will pick up bakery items tomorrow,positive
Have to be honest not that good. Waited 15 minutes to place my order with one person ahead of me. Hot fudge not hot at all. Mediocre at best and EXPENSIVE,negative
"If there was an option to put more than five stars, I would. Got a baker's dozen donuts which was more than enough. I am not a fan of the designer donuts trend... but this place blows Pinkbox and O Face out of the water. We tried all the 'fun varieties' including the delicious and decadent S'mores pop tart donut. My colleague loved the vegan creme brÃ»lÃ©e one the best even not as a vegan. I loved the maple bourbon and the caramel latte one the best. Absolutely delicious and welcome to Vegas. PS if you buy twelve they give you a free donut!",positive
My two stars are for the decor and ambiance which are both quite cool. There is an assortment of pastries behind the glass and decided to try a few. Major disappointment!! Pastries seemed stale with no flavor and the prices weren't cheap. I did enjoy the artistic and unique touches around the place and think it would do much better as a gift shop instead of bakery.,negative
Stopped in to make a quick purchase of a bottle of milk. They were in the process of closing and had one person working the counter and three people cleaning up in the restaurant. Literally stood at the cash register for four minutes with a bottle of milk no one else in the place except one person mine something at the counter. Finally asked one of the people closing the restaurant down/bakery hey do you sell this milk or not? Oh I only clean up he only cleans up she's the only person that can help you keep your milk keep your crappy cookies next.,negative
"There are few things in life that make me as happy as really good chocolate and really good ice cream. Thus sweet republic is my personal temple to the ice cream gods, where I go to worship the two asian artisan ladies who invent the weirdest and coolest and most delicious flavours of ice cream I have tasted. Wow. Everything is made in house with real, fresh ingredients (as in real mint for the peppermint ice cream). On weekends you can enjoy caramelised bacon flavoured ice cream and their salted caramel is their overall best seller. Their sorbets are definately worth a try too. A tasty, lower ""impact"" alternative to their full cream varieties. Dont be shy to try exotic things such as their three cheese ice cream or chocolate turtle (chocolate with fudge swirls and cashews), my favourite. Whatever you do, order some salted caramel sauce on top of your creation if you have even the smallest hope it may go with your chosen flavour. It is THE BEST! And on a chocolate ice cream it is an absolute dream. The ladies are always friendly and happy to let you try their alchemical concoctions. A lovely place to unashamedly live out all of your wildest ice cream fantasies.",positive
I was so upset when I walked down the Linq to get one of my favorite cupcakes last night and found they are closed . I wish I would have bought one from the ATM at the airport when we flew in. Are you located anywhere else in. Eggs?,positive
"Well, it was 46F when I decided I needed to have ice cream!!!!! Can't let the opportunity pass and went in to get me some espresso oreo!! The shop was practically empty. I wasn't surprised because it was freezing then. The ice cream was really good. I especially like coffee flavored ice cream and this one didn't disappoint. I failed to take a pic of it just because I was hurrying to go back to my hotel. I will definitely come back and get the other coffee flavored ice cream they have.",positive
What a fun experience not to mention tasty. Long queues shows what an experience this is . Imagine a waffle shaped as fish filled with flavor and ice team Astounding good dessert,positive
"I go to Amelie's because of their free Wi Fi (even though it is pretty slow and unsecured) and delicious, bold coffee. I don't know how someone can't like Amelie's..... it's such an eclectic mix of everything-decor, people, pastries, smiles, hipsters and drinks. Of course, the one thing that Amelie's has that many other places don't is the open- 24 -hours-factor. That is one of my major gripes about places in this area since I moved from the west where there seemed to be alot more 24 hours places. Why don't more businesses in the area see that that right there is a cash cow? Plus, I believe freaks come out at night so it's a fabulous people watching experience. Anywho, the fact that they are open 24 hours and I actually feel safe walking to and from my car at 1AM or 2AM is a major plus. Their chai latte is one of the best I've had and I keep swearing I am going to try more of their pastries but my booty begs me not to. I love Amelie's--more businesses should take after them",positive
"What a disaster. This place does not live up to the hype. The pastries were dry, coffee just so-so and the service was clueless. The Uptown location tries to be 'lively and hip' but it comes off as plastic and busy. Better places to spend my time and $'s",negative
"Place is amazing. Let me say that donuts are my weakness!!!! So many people would be surprised to pay 3-6 bucks for a donut, but I honestly say... worth it! I had the French toast donut! Amazing. Served with butter and syrup, also with a side of blue berry jelly. I destroyed it. I've also tried the pop tart donut, the birthday cake, Creame BrÃ»lÃ©e, samoa, oreo, and red velvet. All ok. I would say try the pop tart one, but it's share it. It's super rich and filling.",positive
"Really great stop in place. Good price, service, and most importantly... great ice cream!",positive
"Came here on Tuesday. First time. The ice cream was GREAT, the location is good, & the place was over all clean! My only issue was.., they had maybe 6 people working because they CAN get very very busy. This time, around 5pm on Tuesday they were not very busy so some of the people working were just standing around. (Which again, Idc not a big deal) my friend & i ordered our ice cream & sat down on the bar stool area that faces inside the ice cream shop. One of the employees took a taster spoon and samples a flavor, ok nothing wrong with that. He then used the same spoon and dipped it back into the ice cream to take another sample, so double dipped into the ice cream he was serving the customers. I continued to watch him & he did this TWICE! SAME SPOON!!!! NOT sanitary & I'm not sure they should even be eating as customers are walking up to order . Makes me think twice about coming back. If this is happening right in front of customers, whats happening behind the scenes ? (granted, because we were sitting outside facing the inside of the store, maybe he didnt think anyone was watching?)",negative
"It's past midnight and still 90 degrees out. Cookies and ice cream sounded like the perfect snack. I'm not adventurous when it comes to ice cream because of my tree nut allergy so I had an oatmeal/sugar cookie (correction: snickerdoodle) vanilla ice cream sandwich. Both cookies were chewy, but a bit salty and didn't compliment the ice cream well. Even my friend thought I make a better cookie. The ice cream was a bit soft, but that's understandable with the Vegas heat. I will have to return to try a cupcake. They looked really good and had exotic flavors.",positive
"Overpriced. The wait is forever. Don't order anything when you are in a hurry. Bubble milk tea is not as good as CocoMero. The only good thing is that they make it after you order it so you can adjust it by ""less sugar"", ""less ice"", etc. as opposed to the pre-made milk tea at CocoMero which you can't ask for less sugar. Besides that, CocoMero serves better milk tea (better taste with a similar price). Pistachio macaroons are okay (don't compare them to LadurÃ©e). Other flavors are ""meh"". Staff is nice today.",negative
"After watching the Christina Tosi episode on Chefs Table, I knew I had to try that crack pie and birthday cake. I was already planning my trip here the next time I'd be in Vegas. We drove all the way from San Diego for the Super Bowl weekend, and this was our first stop on the strip. I love walking around the pretty Cosmopolitan hotel lobby already, and so it was a bonus that this place is here. My husband wanted to try the cereal milk soft serve with cornflakes, and I got a slice of crack pie and a slice of birthday cake. 1. Birthday cake: it was OK - not something extraordinary or out of this world, it it tasted just like a boxed funfetti cake mix, but elevated to culinary pastry chef standards (which was what she was going for). I'm just not a fan of that particular flavor of cake, but my favorite part about it was the cream cheese frosting in between layers 2. Crack pie: good, but in my opinion WAYYYY too sweet! It would be a good pairing with some strong black coffee to cut the sweetness a little bit. I was looking forward to trying this the most, but sadly it was way underwhelming. 3. Soft serve: The surprise of the day. I didn't think I would like it, but this was my favorite thing I tried. The cornflake-flavored milk in the ice cream really did take me back to my childhood and it was just the right amount of sweetness If I ever come back again I'd get the soft serve and maybe try the birthday cake truffles.",positive
"Anyone that gives Jarlings Custard Cup below a 5 star rating is functionally insane, or, they were huffing spray paint in the preceding 5 hours before enjoying their tasty treats. Seriously, Jarlings is that good. To those drawing similarities between their product and ice cream? You're gastronomically challenged. Yes they are both cold and dairy based, but it ends there. Their custard is obviously so much denser and creamier than ice cream. Ice cream by process has to have a bunch of air stirred into it. The only knock on the Jarling organization is that they don't want to franchise it or distribute the secret process. Jarlings inc world wide could have an IPO greater than Google's ;)",positive
"Between the Keller name and the price, I told Beth, ""this better be flamin' amazing!"" We had ham and cheese on a baguette and.... It was met my requirement. The baguette was the best I've had. Ever. The meat and cheese made this a sparse European style sandwich, but the quality was excellent. Beth loved her cappuccino and my mocha was great. We saved our kougin aman for tomorrow, but the piece I broke off means my will power will be sorely tempted.",positive
"Live on the edge and indulge yourself in a delicious cupcake! Heavy on the frosting, moist cake, and spot on with the defined flavor (lemon was incredible)! Price point $3.50 is what you'd find anywhere locally - so for Strip pricing even nice.",positive
"VERY Yummy! I was so happy to see Bouchon Bakery as soon as I hoped off the elevator this morning. I paid them a visit, twice :) The bread pudding was SO good and the chocolate Bouchon amazing! What a nice treat this morning, accompanied by a non fat latte. Later in the day I had another and tried a double chocolate cookie, everything looked amazing. This is the perfect place for breakfast or a tasty treat. I can't wait to try Bouchon next time I'm in town. I wanted to order one of everything to bring home with me. Fabulous!",positive
"Everything they have is cheap, all of their staff are friendly, their Ice Cream is very good, not to mention their Donuts. You'll find something you'll like here, without a doubt.",positive
"The cake was great, however nothing I couldn't get at Grand luxury cafe for less time. I gave two stars because we waited 25 minutes because the bakery was so inefficiently run in order to create a line and grab interest. That is a fail like. When we could have been out in/out in 5 minutes.",negative
"Oh man!! This place is SO good! It's a little ice cream shop near downtown phx. It's a cute cozy place. The owner, Brandon, is super nice, and very helpful. You could tell he loved his shop. He gave my boyfriend and I suggestions, and told us what exactly was in each flavor. There's eight total flavors, half is limited, while the other half their signature flavors. I had a limited flavor which was the Black Raspberry Cashew, boy do I tell you, it is the BEST ice cream I've had in awhile! I was contemplating on getting it in a warm glazed donut until the Leslie Knope (love the name by the way) caught my eye. It's a warm waffle sandwich. You also get a free topping with it, so I got the basic sprinkle (boring I know) but it was so good! Thinking about it now makes me wish I had one. My boyfriend had the Leslie Knope as well but with the Cookie Monster flavor (one of their signatures). That was also delicious! It is definitely a must try! You will not regret it!",positive
"Update--service is a bit better than before (compared to a year ago) however, the wait time is still on the longer side. As for taste, it is still on the lower quality. Their milk teas and bubble teas are still powder based which doesn't surprise me as it is part of a chain. However it blows my mind that something as simple as milk tea requires powder packets for the sake of convenience. As for their coffees, I'd love to see the beans treated with the respect they deserve. There's much more than just sticking a label on it ""from Ethiopia"" or ""Fair Trade"". Overall, it's not somewhere I would choose to go to.",negative
"Delicious! I had the cookie cup with chocolate gelato, a caramel cookie and roasted marshmallow on top ! Great gelato!!",positive
"Years, you guys. My visit to the Milk Bar has been at least 4 YEARS in the making, when I first heard about the amazing Crack Pie and Cereal Milk ice cream. I don't even remember where I heard about it but it's been in the back of my mind since then. I even made a copycat Crack Pie recipe that won a pie contest and was AMAZING. So I just HAD to try the real thing! Ugh it was disappointing. I mean the crack pie was okay but I'd rather just have like a $1 candy bar or something. The cereal milk ice cream was interesting at first bite but after that I just didn't want to eat it anymore, and that's not like me to stop eating ice cream. I couldn't finish it. My husband couldn't either. I think he was annoyed that I'd hyped this place up so much. Sorry hon. But now I know I can make a copycat crack pie that's better than the original!",negative
"Decided to try this out because of the hype around it. The corn flake flavored soft serve ice cream is certainly not worth the $6.00 they charge. If you want it sprinkled with some corn flakes, be prepared to fork out an additional $2.50 for a few cornflakes. The crack pie flavored soft serve was better, but maybe not worth $6.00 for a small portion.",negative
"This place is not ideal for large groups. I took a group of about 18 girls to Churn for a celebration and we experienced the utmost rudest customer service ever. We called the day before to give the workers a heads up that we would be coming in with a larger group. However, when we arrived our group was rushed, spoken to like children, and even had some of our orders tossed at us instead of handed to us like a good paying customer. When we were leaving we could overhear the workers talking about some of our girls in an inappropriate manner. I believe that this type of treatment was uncalled for as we did our best to insure that our group treated the workers with respect and grace even though that was not the treatment that we were given. I am so disappointed because our girls were so excited for this celebration and it was tainted by the workers contempt. Like I said, this is not a good place to take large groups if you are wanting friendly service.",negative
"The worst ""milkshake"" I've ever had, I took a single sip and that was enough. Too much milk and not enough ice cream resulted in a really watery consistency. The shake was so thin that after 5 minutes of sitting, the blended cookie pieces all floated up to the top. The flavor is okay to mediocre, but I wanted a milkshake and not a milkslush.",negative
"I like this place, has charm. For me it is the second best place to get ice cream.",positive
"Major fail. If this place is supposed to be a great representation of Pittsburgh's offerings... Pittsburgh is in trouble. :( It was a hot night. So of course we wanted ice cream. Dude... the soft serve was just a melted mess!! It was more like a gross milkshake cuz it was so liquidy. But it also tasted like hell. I ordered a coffee arctic w heath bar candy. How dare she claim that it's like a blizzard!?! This thing was nowhere near a blizzard! I could mix ingredients better at home. And w better flavor. Then... the kid ordered the mango soft serve. The server said, ""we dont have mango."" We had to point it out to her on the menu. They dont offer samples. She said, its ""probably"" good. Um... no... it was not good at all. It was so disgusting that my kid couldnt even eat it. And we NEVER throw away ice cream!! Tip to the business: if your soft serve is a hot melted mess... dont open your doors until you fix your refrigeration problem.",negative
"Very disappointed! Soups taste like regular cheap soup ""Maruchan soup"" the picture they have online don't look like the soup i get yesterday noodles really thick no flavor i pay $44 for two soup and two ice cream waste of many! I never come back again!",negative
"Pastries at this place are delish. Flavorful and flakey. The macaroons are a must get as well. If we are at the Venetian for what ever reason, we always go here.",positive
"Oh Carlo's bakery, you have lost your identity. Came in on a Saturday around noon to satisfy my east coast cravings and there were NO BLACK AND WHITE COOKIES, LOBSTER TAILS or TIRAMISU! Originally came in looking for rainbow cookies and ended up leaving highly dissatisfied. Dense and stale, no flavor whatsoever. This place is a sad excuse for a bakery that has simple treats that you can find anywhere else. A major disappointment and just another west coast bakery charging premium prices for average cannolis and fresh baked sugar cookies. I didn't come here for the name, I came here for the classic baked goods. You go in with high hopes of an Italian east coast bakery and leave feeling unsatisfied and disappointed.",negative
"Items Selected: Samples - Drunk'n Nut, Arizona Sunrise, Wine n' Cheese Single Churro Single White Chocolate Raazz with Sprinkles Triple - Cap'n Crunch, Drunk'n Nut, Twisted Delight No doubt playing the Instagram-era plating game by way of Chinese take-out containers complete with Cookie, Central City's Melt takes Phoenicians on a flavor-trip by way of housemade Ice Cream with a texture somewhere between hand-dipped and soft serve presented by clerks who try entirely too hard to be funny. Located in a converted former-home on 5th Street, this odd style of makeshift dining space familiar to locals but a bit disconcerting to visitors given signage posted along a low fence, those entering Melt are immediately bombarded by high decibels of Punk and bad puns paired to samples, a limit of three almost a point of pride even when the shop was otherwise uncrowded. Trying to make conversation about the product, flavors like ""Arizona Sunrise"" that are not especially obvious described with a snarky response before finally yielding ""like a Creamsicle"" it was with small tastes of savory Wine n' Cheese plus a riff on Humphry Slocombe's ""Secret Breakfast"" that decisions were made, though not before the young man chastised one in the party for adding Sprinkles that ""taste like chalk."" Getting past the service, or lack thereof, including an unwillingness to sell a friend less than a full pound of Chamoy Gummy Bears, further tastes of Melt confirmed a semi-soft texture quite unlike most modern-day Artisans while flavors trended sweet yet not ""sugary,"" the Churro essentially just Vanilla with a bit of Cinnamon while White Chocolate Razz was even milder, and thus quite different from the yeasty Cereal Milk flavored Cap'n Crunch or ""Twisted Delight"" of Strawberries and Balsamic.",negative
"Never leave yelp reviews but me and my fiancÃ© stopped here for some sandwiches . I got a sandwich that had turkey , bacon, lettuce , tomato, and onion . I asked for no turkey and to add mayonnaise . When out food arrived my sandwich already came with mayonnaise on it without them telling me or having it on the menu while charging us for extra ,they placed ONE single piece of bacon on the sandwich . When I asked if I could possibly have more bacon I was told yes no problem . 1 minute later the lady at the register says that will be $2 meanwhile I already took a meat off the sandwich and they charged me for something it already came with . Won't ever be coming back and don't recommend the sandwiches . Ice cream looks very good but the food is just not good at all and no one seems to be in charge .",negative
"Ehhhhh. This place is very expensive, but everyone knows that. A cannoli and lobster tail was a little under $12. The cannoli was alright. The shell was a bit hard and there was a TON of filling. Way too much. It tasted fine. The hazelnut lobster tail was nasty. I don't know what the hell that filling is, but it was so bitter. Chewing the outside was exhausting. It made my jaw hurt. I ended up throwing it away. I only gave it two stars because customer service was good. Everyone there was very friendly and prompt.",negative
"In the middle of the touristy LINQ part of the strip, right near the High Roller. Pretty pricey for an ice cream sundae, but big enough to share and very delicious. Got the Cookie Dough Sundae and I believe it was around $13. I've also been to the Ghirardelli in San Francisco and this one was a lot smaller and a lot less crowded - probably waited about 10 minutes for my sundae. Definitely stop in here for an afternoon or night snack after lunch or dinner!",positive
"Second chance and disappointed a second time. My cream puff tasted like it was frozen then thawed. I guess the rumors were correct in saying that Amelie's freezes a lot of their baked goods. If I wanted frozen I would have went to Costco! Heading to Dillworth to Sweet Lorraine's, where everything is fresh. Amelies, is not worth the wait in line. I won't be returning.",negative
"What a novel concept! (Pun intended.) And I'm not just talking about the interesting flavors, such as the honey Sriracha (hippy, I know, but keep an opened mind and read on), Novel has to offer but the enthusiasm and genuine human kindness from the staff. Tucked in a little house on a cul-de-sac of eateries, Novel is cute and homey and is a rather small ice cream parlor, but good things can come in small packages (or at least some good things...) As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by very friendly people who were more than happy to let us try whatever we want. Now I am a traditionalist when it comes to ice cream and sweets but I am not going to turn down trying ""honey sriracha"". My theory was ""I like honey and I like sriracha; I should try it!"" Well, let's just say I was glad I tried it because now I don't have to try it again anymore! It was definitely not bad and very interesting, but I learned that I prefer my ice cream to be sweet and non-spicy. I also tried the honey lavender and it was the perfect balance of honey and lavender, which I think is pretty difficult to achieve due to the two flavors being relatively mellow on its own. Nevertheless, I cannot eat a whole scoop of honey lavender just because it's too avant-garde for me. But butter pecan? That I can do a whole scoop, and then some. Saw it, tried it, loved it, getting it. I know butter pecan belongs to the lackluster ice cream flavors category, but this is probably by far the best butter pecan ice cream I've ever had. My partner had the donut ice cream sandwich and I had a bite. I must admit it was much better than I had anticipated. In fact, I wouldn't have mind if I had a donut sandwich for myself. The donut tasted fresh and soft without being too sweet. The ice cream in the donut was some sort of peanut butter and banana. It had some crunchy graham cracker/cereal as well, but I forget what it was. Everything combined together was a match well made. The patio outside has tables and chairs and is lit with Christmas lights. The ambiance is relaxing and lovely. All in all, I would normally avoid places that serve ""hand-crafted artisan ice cream"" just because of the stigma that usually come with that kind of labeling but I am glad I tried Novel and the interesting ice cream flavors and met the friendly crew. And if you haven't tried this place, I'd say it'd be a novel thing to do to give it a whirl.",positive
"The wait time wasn't very long, but I would think that with such a popular bakery that there would be a better system of ordering:( you have to wait in a line that cuts in front of the door, then you only see the pastries that are in front of you, not past you because there are people in line. By the time it's your turn you need to know exactly what you want because the girls helping act like they don't have time to wait for you to decide. Out of the 3 girls working, I was hoping to get the one that seemed to like being there (we did) whew... Cannolis were okay, lobster tails a little hard, crumb bun (skip it very dry, you will need milk or coffee). I'll still watch the shows, but won't be visiting the bakery again. Go to Bouchon Bakery around the corner baked goods are amazing, staff super friendly, and prices are reasonable.",negative
"Having heard so much about it, and being a complete sugar-head, I REALLY wanted to like this place. It's open 24 hours and the caramel salted brownie is quite good. But, after 3 visits, I have tried several pastries and cakes and they are just ok at best and at worst kind of tasteless and spongy/heavy. The desserts are chilled and for some of them it makes them worse for the wear-- such as anything that is supposed to be flaky. Cute decor does not make up for mediocre sweets. I have yet to try their lunch/breakfast offerings, so maybe this is what keeps other reviewers so enthused.",negative
This place sucks! Don't go here. The Sfogliatelle are horrible and the rest is substandard! The staff was extremely non accommodating to our simple request to add maraschino cherries to the ends if our sons overly sweetened cannoli!,negative
Service was great everyone was very nice and personable. We just about got one of everything and there wasn't anything we didn't enjoy. Would recommend anyone with a sweet tooth in Vegas to go here. I think my favorite was the cookies and cream lobster tail. It was light and crisp but not to hard and didn't get soggy from the cream inside. I'm a soft cookie fan and the cookies were on the harder side but they tasted fantastic.,positive
Sorely disappointed. The hot fudge sundae was lukewarm at best and turned my stomach upside down. We tried to non pareils and the box didn't close and the woman at the front was flippant about it when we asked for a different one which she didn't and just stuck a sticker on it. And the box still didn't work.They haven't had brownies for 2 weeks but no where did they have a sign which indicated that. Only reason I gave 2 stars instead of one is that I like Ghirardelli chocolate but rest of the experience was subpar. I realize places are understaffed and it must be a challenge to find good employees.,negative
"The bread was good, as was the sandwich, however took an extremely long time for a toasted sandwich, and we wanted to get a baguette to take back down to our hotel, but wanted it cut in half to fit in backpack, they said they couldn't cut it in half cause the knife is only for sandwiches.....ok so you can cut the bread for sandwiches with your knife but not bread the customer is buying? What bakery doesn't cut the bread for you?",negative
"Ramen Review: 0/10 It was in one word, bland. The meat had no flavor, the broth had no flavor and the bowls were half empty leaving us very disappointed with our food plan this evening. Ice Cream Review: 4/10 We've been here a few times for ice cream and the general consensus is the ice cream itself is pretty good but the price is too expensive for what you get. As far as I know, this is the most expensive ice cream in Ohio but certainly not the best.",negative
"We are frequent patrons of this place, and we like to try the variety of flavors, we are four of family and this takes a little time ... this Tiara cashier, not friendly and apparently had a bad day, nothing friendly !! In the 4 times we have been here she's had a bad day ??  The ice cream is great!",negative
"Amelie's is a great spot to catch up with friends, get work done, and satisfy your sweet tooth. We stop by Amelie's quite frequently to pick up a sweet treat or breakfast sandwiches. The interior is quite intriguing with the variety of colors and different design styles. It is spacious with a good amount of seating but it tends to get packed very quickly!! The lines wrap around since it's such a go to spot for many. Our favorites are their macarons (Pistachio and Salted Caramel) and their cinnamon sticks! As for breakfast sandwiches, we tend to do the build your own and customize it to our likings.",positive
"I am so psyched--I have one of their new mugs that you can get for about $13, so now every time I go refills of their liquid heaven are only $1!! Deal of the century---now I really wish they would open one closer to Salisbury!",positive
"Great donuts, not overly sweet and coffee was strong which I loved. The staff is very patient and friendly. Will def be back! ( the creme brÃ»lÃ©e & pop tart donuts are worth the trip)",positive
"I was excited to try the place. I've been to Bouchon (restaurant) and it was a good experience. I was hoping that the bakery was as good. We got some macaroons and a croissant. I expected better especially for the price. The macaroon fillings were too sweet. The croissant was cold and not flaky. It was just a bit better than the ones you get from Costco. Therefore, it wasn't worth the price. You can almost get a whole box of croissants at Costco for one croissant here.",negative
One of my daughters favorite ice cream places! I love the piÃ±a colada Boba! Everything is delicious,positive
The best damn cupcakes I've ever had in my life. MOIST AND HEAVY!!!! I had the Belgian chocolate and the peanut butter. Absolutely amazing. 2 cupcakes were around $7.50. Yummo!!!!!,positive
"Iscalet was the most fabulous associate. She was friendly she was competent and she deserves a raise! The ice cream was insanely good, I sampled a few and decided on peanut butter and Rockyroad in a waffle cone, which was crisp and delicious. This was the perfect dessert after a wonderful Chinese dinner",positive
"Meh. Not impressed. Got an ice cream flight- 5 flavors. Creamy? Yes, but flirting with ice milk texture. Flavors are ok - not intense. It's as if they took the same vanilla base - then added stuff to it. The giveaway to my hunch? The Salty Caramel. Salty? Yes. Caramel? Not really true caramel. The color of the ice cream was vanilla white. I don't believe it's possible to make any kind of caramel without some sort of brownish hue. I'm a trained and working pastry chef - so guys, get back in the kitchen and fine tune. You have a fun store concept and it seems all the hipsters dig it. But without substance, I'm afraid your devotees will move on to the next trend.",negative
Disappointed. Got there at 8 so I wouldn't have a long wait. They opened 20 minutes late and I only went there for a cannoli and cheese cake and they didn't even have any.,negative
"Updating my review to this place because I went back with my boyfriend a second time. Although the girl working was really nice, I had noticed that there were no chocolate based flavors. For how many options they had, I thought that was a little crazy to not have a traditional chocolate flavor (or even a chocolate peanut butter or something). Biggest reason for the review change---Last time I rated this place, my boyfriend was the one making the purchase, so he paid. This time, we went for the special they have which adds a macaroon and a toasted marshmallow on top of your ice cream. I thought the menu board said they were $10 each (which is too much money for what you get, in my opinion). I remember tipping on top of it. And then when I checked my bank statement the next day, it said I spent $28.24 here. Almost $30 for essentially two scoops of ice cream plus some toppings?! PASS! I don't think I'll come back here if these are their prices because their ice cream is not worth that much. Even had I tipped 20% (which I think I did), it should have been $25 (again too much....) so to randomly add an over $8 tip is outrageous for what you are getting. I'm not sure how that happened but I doubt I'd come back. If I do....someone else better be paying.",negative
First of all they shouldn't have kids working there second the lines are so long.i know buddy wouldn't like the quality of the pastries his workers are putting out the pastries look like crap and way over priced.plz fix the lobster tail.,negative
Wish I could give zero stars. What I will add is the huge lack of respect the owner must have for their own customers. I waited in line 25 minutes. And then another 30 minutes to get my stuff. Should of done what several people did- leave! Feel bad for the tourist who are wasting their precious time in Vegas to buy the crap they are selling here. Hire more employees to pack orders. Although this might be intentional to make people think they are more popular than they are. If you have a car - go to Bagel Cafe. GPS it. Much of what you buy at Carlos can be found here. Many times better & for less money.,negative
OMG! WOW WOW WOW! Have a customer sent us a few boxes of macaroons from here and I'm not even a macaroon fan but these were to die for! I mean every flavor was delicious! I had never heard of this place but apparently its pretty famous around here. I am for sure gonna go order some more macaroons!,positive
"This place is expensive. I guess you would call it Vegas (tourist) prices!!! From the show, lobster tails and cannolis are their specialty. Nothing fantastic, lobster tail is like croissant with pastry cream and the cannoli has a ricotta filling. They sell a small box of assorted butter cookies for just under $10.00 and I mean small!! Been there, no need to go back!!",negative
"Donuts may look and taste good but if you are looking for employment here, look away. The management is horrible & do not pay their staff for the amount of work they do especially the bakers. They have also had incidents where they did not pay their staff at all for all the overtime hours they were forced to work. Ridiculous working environment. And a tip from a fellow past worker, get your donuts in the morning or else they will taste old and stale by the end of the day.",negative
I signed up for the perks and received a free cupcake for my birthday. I chose the carrot cake cupcake and it was delicious. I would for sure go there again and purchase a cupcake. (It is located right by the ferris wheel.),positive
I've been a fan of Carlo because of his show Cake Boss so I was pretty excited to try his pastries out in Vegas. It is located inside of the Venetian across from his restaurant. We got there on a Saturday night around 10 PM and there was only a small line so the wait was not too bad. I would recommend not coming during this time because they were out of the two things I really wanted to try and their most popular items (Lobster Tail and Canoli). The selection was pretty limited at this time so I only got a California Cheesecake. I order/paid and then had to wait about 10 minutes to pickup my order. I didn't really understand this because all they have to do is box the Cheesecake. The cheesecake itself was alight but definitely not worth the price ($11) at all. I might come back to try the lobster tail and canolis but was not wowed at all by my first experience here.,negative
DON'T GO! The spinach shrimp sandwich made me super sick. Ended up ruining my birthday because I needed to be near a bathroom. Save your money and your toilet.,negative
